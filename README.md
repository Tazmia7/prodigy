# 🌍 World Population Data Analysis

This project explores and visualizes the distribution of world population data using Python.  
It demonstrates the difference between **categorical** and **continuous** variables through effective data visualization techniques.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

The notebook analyzes global population data to:
- Visualize population distribution across **continents**
- Identify the **Top 10 countries** with the highest population
- Explore the **distribution of population** using a histogram

These visualizations help in understanding how populations vary across regions and scales.

## 📈 Visualizations Included

1. **Bar Chart – Population by Continent**  
   - Represents a *categorical variable* (continent)  
   - Shows total population per continent  

2. **Bar Chart – Top 10 Countries by Population**  
   - Highlights countries with the largest populations  

3. **Histogram – Population Distribution**  
   - Represents a *continuous variable* (population)  
   - Displays how country populations are distributed globally
